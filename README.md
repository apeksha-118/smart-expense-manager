Smart Expense Manager
A simple Python-based expense tracker that uses AI-powered categorization and SQLite for persistent storage. This project helps you manage daily expenses by automatically categorizing them based on descriptions you provide.
Features
Add, view, and manage expenses via a command-line interface (CLI).

AI-driven expense categorization using rule-based keyword matching.

Persistent storage using SQLite database (expenses.db).

Easily extendable for web UI integration (e.g., Streamlit or Flask).

How It Works
User inputs expense amount, description, and optionally date.

The AI module scans the description for keywords and assigns a relevant category.

The expense is stored in an SQLite database.

Users can view all expenses or filter by category/date using built-in functions.
